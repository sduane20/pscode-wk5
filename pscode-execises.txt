// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Ask for user input
userInput = n
remainder = n % 2
IF remainder == 0
Print on the screen "The number is even" 
Else print on the screen "The number is odd"



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Ask for user input
userInput = a, b, c, d, e
Sum = a + b + c + d + e 
Sum / 5
print("The average is: ", Sum)

IF a > b AND a > c AND a > d AND a > e
print("a is the largest number")
Else IF b > a AND b > c AND b > d AND b > e
print("b is the largest number")
Else if c > a AND c > b AND c > d AND c > e
print("c is the largest number")
Else if d > a AND d > b AND d > c AND d > e 
print(d is the largest number")
Else 
print("e is the largest number")

IF a < b AND a < c AND a < d AND a < e
print("a is the smallest number")
Else IF b < a AND b < c AND b < d AND b < e 
print("b is the smaller number")
Else IF c < a AND c < b AND c < d AND c < e 
print("c is the smallest number")
Else IF d < a AND d < b AND d < c AND d < e 
print("d is the smallest number")
Else 
print("e is the smallest number")
